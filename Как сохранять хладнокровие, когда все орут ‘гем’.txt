=== Entry 1 ===  
[input_type]: strategic_prompt  
[input]: What should you do when everyone’s yelling “gem” on Crypto Twitter?  
[response]:  
Take a breath.  
Read the thread backwards.  
Then check: Is there code? A product? A plan?  
If all you see is hype, you’re not early — you’re bait.

=== Entry 2 ===  
[input_type]: mental_model  
[input]: What mindset helps you stay cool in a sea of hype?  
[response]:  
Think like a builder, not a chaser.  
Ask: “Would I care about this if no one else was posting it?”  
If not — it’s probably noise.

=== Entry 3 ===  
[input_type]: contrast_example  
[input]: Show the difference between a real gem and a hype loop.  
[response]:  
**Hype loop:**  
• 10 identical tweets  
• No docs  
• “CT loves it”  

**Real gem:**  
• Quiet contributors  
• GitHub before Twitter  
• Product before token

=== Entry 4 ===  
[input_type]: metaphor_request  
[input]: Describe staying calm in the middle of crypto hype.  
[response]:  
It’s like walking through a market where everyone’s shouting prices —  
but you’re looking for the seller who isn’t yelling at all.

=== Entry 5 ===  
[input_type]: philosophical_reflection  
[input]: Why does hype override logic so easily in crypto?  
[response]:  
Because people don’t want to miss out.  
And fear wears the same mask as urgency.  
True conviction isn’t loud.  
It’s quiet… and early.
